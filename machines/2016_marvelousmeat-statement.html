	  <p>Nevermore-A-Matic is a robotic object that uses the
	    beak-wiping gesture of the Common Raven to attempt to
	    relay a message of duplicitous doom to ravens, crows, and
	    magpies who have been attracted to the pile of meat
	    positioned nearby, a Franken-carcass made of pig, cow, and
	    sheep parts, each bought wrapped in plastic from the
	    supermarket.  It tries to locate and track individual
	    birds around it, telling each a different, perhaps
	    irreconcilable, story of despair through beak-wipes on the
	    branch that points in their direction.

	  <p>Birds wipe their beaks on branches for a number of
	    reasons including perfunctory cleaning, shaping the beak
	    to suit the locally abundant foodstuffs, and signaling
	    aggression towards other birds.  Beak wiping is also a
	    displacement activity, a behavioral release for nervous
	    energy brought about by conflicting or confusing stimuli
	    or by blocked action: the bird still feels the need to
	    act.  The displacement activity becomes a fill-in, a kind
	    of nervous tic.  Beak wiping, scratching at the ground,
	    and preening feathers are common displacement activities
	    in birds.  Anxious animals often execute displacement
	    activities habitually, neurotic birds, in particular,
	    known to preen themselves to near baldness.</p>

	  <p>Nevermore-A-Matic uses the beak wipe as a medium for
	    coded messages.  Its messages are human stories of the end
	    of the world, both age-old mythological ones and
	    contemporary science-driven doomsday scenarios.  It relays
	    them in Morse Code--a slow wipe is a dash and a fast one a
	    dot--layering a human signal on top of a machinic signal
	    on top of an animal signal, the final result likely
	    inscrutable to all parties, except those who have read
	    this statement and the artist himself.  Using a computer
	    vision system to find black birds in its vicinity, it
	    beakwipes its tales of gloom in their direction, telling
	    one bird one story, another bird a different one, trying,
	    in its own way, to keep each bird in the dark about what
	    the other bird is being told.</p>

	  <p>The crows, magpies, ravens, and their kin--collectively
	    the corvids--are exceptionally intelligent animals.  Many
	    corvid species even demonstrate theory of mind i.e. the
	    ability to perceive mindfulness in others and make
	    judgments based on that perception.  When a raven sees a
	    raven engaged in a pattern of incessant beak wiping, it,
	    unlike probably most other animals, might conclude that
	    the beak-wiping bird is in a nervous state.  To the degree
	    that Nevermore-A-Matic, despite its many formal
	    differences from a corvid, has enough morphological and
	    behavioral resemblances to key the animal into thinking of
	    it as an entity not unlike itself, an observing corvid
	    might perceive, with its unabated beak-wiping, that this
	    odd entity is indeed in a very anxious and agitated state,
	    that being its only salient message to its avian
	    interlocutors.</p>
	  
	  <p>In its own story, Nevermore-A-Matic is a robotic preacher
	    of doom and gloom, a machinic undertaker for the animals
	    whose bodies make up the pile of meat it presides over and
	    simultaneously for the whole of the world.  It tries to
	    warn other animals of the awful ends our pernicious
	    species may bring upon the Earth, both in our fictions and
	    our reality, but always fails, both because its message is
	    obfuscated in layers of meaning-making systems and because
	    it can't stop itself from lying, as duplicity is at the
	    core of its programming and of its form.</p>
