	<div class="projectpage-description">

	  <p>Western Fence Lizards declare their territories and fight
	    their battles by doing pushups.  Their basic territorial
	    pushup is a bobbing motion executed with the front legs at
	    a particular frequency between two levels of
	    leg-extension, both greater than the sprawled position of
	    a lizard not actively engaged in territorial dispute.

	  <p>The scientist, Stephen Adolph, studies Western Fence
	    Lizards and told me that they come out of the egg already
	    hyper-sensitive perceptually to the frequency and pattern
	    of the pushup and that their neuromuscular system is, even
	    at the early age, hyper-ready to do the pushup, the
	    hatchlings doing juvenile versions of the pushup the way a
	    human infant kicks their legs in anticipation of walking,
	    the species' distinctive staccato bobbing the pervasive
	    rhythm of the lizards' lives.

	  <p>As they grow to become adults, the lizards increasingly
	    use the pushup from the best perches in their territories
	    to broadcast their claim to their small domains. These
	    basic territorial pushups are executed mostly with the
	    forelimbs and pale in comparison to what the scientists
	    call the "Full Show" which occurs mostly during mating
	    season when the males are the randiest and the most
	    aggressive.

	  <p>In the Full Show, two males will be pushing the
	    boundaries of their territories seeking and hoping to
	    attract mates.  One will find himself in a territory that
	    another thinks is rightfully his and the only recourse
	    becomes an old-fashioned pushup showdown.  These standoffs
	    proceed from the, by comparison, genteel forelimb
	    movements of the basic pushup to pushups that also engage
	    the hindlimbs.  As the enmity of the two combatants grows,
	    they flatten their bodies to display the vibrant blue
	    patches on their bellies (always otherwise hidden from
	    view of predator and conspecific alike), and extend their
	    throats to show the blue there too.

	  <p>At a point the lizards cease the downward bob of their
	    pushup, instead holding themselves rigidly at the pushup's
	    apex.  Now the true competition begins.  The lizards
	    strain to keep themselves in this hyper-erect position,
	    legs straight out below them in almost a mammal-like way,
	    throat and belly blue patches brazenly displayed.  Like a
	    blinking contest, the winner is the one who can hold out
	    longest, the loser the one that calls uncle.  This feat of
	    endurance (only a minute or so long as it is) is truly
	    hard for the lizards to do.  It is therefore what is
	    termed an honest signal, a signal that is actually tied to
	    the health and fitness of the signaler, the winner not a
	    cheat but now a proven superior to the loser.

	  <p>When a lizard loses this fight, they not only drop down
	    from their rigid, erect stance to their natural posture
	    but go beyond it, actually flattening themselves into the
	    ground, in essence going negative on the pushup.  Their
	    machismo, so to speak, is so entirely wrapped up in a few
	    millimeters of height from the ground that a lizard loser
	    must not just submit, but prostrate themselves.

	  <p>During the spring, my yard feels like a pushup war zone
	    or more aptly like a Hollywood Western in which
	    trigger-happy gunslingers are likewise always hyper-ready
	    to enter standoffs for pride and territory, moseying
	    around town just an errant stink-eye or a disputed poker
	    hand away from a bracing showdown.  Like their Hollywood
	    cowboy counterparts, the lizards (who are, incidentally,
	    living within a few miles of Hollywood itself) even appear
	    to have formed little bands of bandits and sheriffs: the
	    Log Pile Posse, the Front Stair Pair, the Fallen Tree
	    Bunch, and, the most notorious, the Gap Crack Gang. I am
	    never certain which group is on which side of the law.

	  <p>My little pushupping automaton, "Nary A Yellow-Bellied
	    Blue Belly," enters the ongoing border disputes between
	    these various bands like Yul Brynner's robotic gunslinger
	    in the 1973 movie "West World."  As with the members of
	    those dueling bands, its perception is keenly attuned to
	    the bobbing pattern of the Western Fence Lizard's
	    distinctive pushup. In fact, its perceptual system is
	    aware of nothing else.  It would not know a lizard that
	    wasn't doing pushups if it came up and smacked it in the
	    lens but it would know a Western Fence Lizard's pushup
	    even if it were Yul Brynner doing one himself. And as soon
	    as the robot sees the pushup, it responds in kind with its
	    own pushup, immediately instigating a pushup skirmish that
	    the lizards dutifully engage in but can't win.  Biological
	    organisms that have such limited energetic resources and
	    so much else they need to accomplish will always lose to a
	    robot whose every part is solely bent on winning the duel.
