        <div class="projectpage-description">

	  <p>Birds, bats, and insects are the only extant groups that
	    contain species that with their own bodies can slip the
	    surly bonds of Earth and fly up into the heavens. They are
	    therefore the only extraterrestrial life-forms with which
	    we routinely have close encounters.</p>
	  
	  <p>The precise act of mating in birds is frequently a
	    fleeting event. Swifts even perform the almost
	    instantaneous procedure while in flight and less frenetic
	    birds like hawks spend hardly longer in love’s
	    embrace. Bird copulation is clearly nothing like the
	    prolonged sessions we associate with the act yet in all
	    likelihood some drive like ours brings the male and the
	    female together and, in the species that stay together for
	    the rearing of young, there is an attachment effected by
	    some mechanism, possibly describable as emotional. Perhaps
	    the interaction in which birds have the experience most
	    like our love-making is not when they mate. Said another
	    way, perhaps for birds mating is not when they truly make
	    love.</p>

	  <p>After two Pileated Woodpeckers have chosen each other as
	    mates, the very next thing they do is seek a suitable tree
	    in which to excavate their nest hole. The male has been
	    “drumming,” i.e., rapidly beating his beak against a
	    resonant tree trunk to produce a territorial signal that
	    echoes through the forest. This has attracted the fine
	    mate who has joined him. Now he switches to “drum-tapping”
	    at a location on a tree that he thinks has desirable
	    qualities for siting a nest. If the female does not agree
	    with his site choice, she will drum-tap on another tree or
	    location. Incrementally, the woodpeckers will narrow their
	    search until they both agree on a site and hence are both
	    drum-tapping on the very same tree in the very same place
	    on the trunk. They then begin the excavation.</p>

	  <p>Throughout this drum-tapping process the two birds are
	    very agitated in their movements and appear to be at an
	    elevated level of excitement, frequently uttering little
	    cries of unfettered glee. Perhaps this tree-seeking
	    procedure is the equivalent in Pileateds to our foreplay
	    or even our sex act. Perhaps the birds feel a mixture of
	    emotional bonding and bodily pleasure from the good
	    vibrations of the drum-tapping that natural selection has
	    favored to align their individual goals with the shared
	    goal of excavating a nest, mating, and eventually rearing
	    young. There are analogues in other avian species; for
	    instance the splashing, synchronized swimming of the
	    Western Grebe. These activities of the woodpeckers and the
	    grebes may seem more like courtship or marital bliss but
	    when the sex is so momentary, so secondary, again they
	    take on more of the emotional significance that does
	    sexual intercourse for humans. In essence, drum-tapping is
	    sex for the woodpeckers.</p>

	  <p>The concept of the sex robot is older than the myth of
	    Pygmalion but for the most part the form is humanoid and
	    the robot is intended to give pleasure to a human in
	    recognizably human ways. We have neglected other
	    possibilities. We have neglected the pleasure of the
	    robot, at least insomuch that if there is such pleasure it
	    is really intended as a secondary vector to pleasure in
	    the human user. We have also neglected that the robot
	    might find pleasure through a non-human animal’s model of
	    sexual activity.</p>

	  <p>I present The Woodiest, a strap-on robotic system that
	    addresses both these neglects. Strapped to a tree in a
	    expansive tract of mature forest in North America, it
	    listens with a microphone for the signature territorial
	    drumming of an invading Pileated Woodpecker. When it hears
	    such drumming, it responds by raising its male sub-system
	    and drumming back, simultaneously declaring its territory
	    and indicating where it would like to build a
	    nest. However, in this case, its mate is built-in: after
	    retracting the male head, the machine raises its female
	    sub-system and drum-taps in the exact same place. The
	    result is an auto-erotic, hermaphroditic, all-in-one
	    woodpecker love-bot. It exists to pleasure itself via the
	    Pileated model and through performing both roles it can
	    fulfill its needs independently of another
	    entity. Besides, of course, the instigating
	    extra-terrestrial invader.</p>
