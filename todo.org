- add the version of Nobody Told the Woodpeckers
- add to little bottom-of-page spiel a list of the exhibitions each
  piece has been in? or maybe just the highlight exhibition.
  something like "Exhibited at the Nikolaj Kunsthal in Copenhagen, Denmark"
- Break out another project page that is On Beyond Mother Goose as the
  gallery piece so that Duck, Duck, Goose has a page and OBMG has one
- Add a page for So Interesting
- Break out another project page for Birds Leap to Fly: Feet the
  gallery piece.
- And then have Birds Leap to Fly: Hands?
