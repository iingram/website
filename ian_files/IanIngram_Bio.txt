Ian Ingram
Bio

Ian Ingram is a Los Angeles-based maker of behavioral sculpture who is
interested in the manmade object's future as a willful entity and the
nature of communication.  He builds mechatronic and robotic systems
that borrow facets from animal morphology and behavior, from the
shapes and movements of machines, and from our stories about
animals. These systems are often intended to cohabitate and interact
with animals in the wild.  The work is playful, humorous even, but is
cloaked in mock seriousness.  Under the seriousness, is the humor.
Under the humor is gravity.  It is a open-faced sandwich built on
aspirational profundity.

Ingram has exhibited his work internationally, including at the Andy
Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, PA; the Museum of Modern Art of Toluca,
Mexico; Art Chicago; the Yada Gallery in Nagoya, Japan; Axiom Gallery
in Boston, MA; Bedford Gallery in Walnut Creek, CA; Purdue University;
Hasbro Headquarters; eyelevelgallery in Halifax, Nova Scotia; and in
Popular Science Magazine. His sculptures are in the collections of the
Carnegie Science Center and the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh.
Ingram has a BS and MS from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and an MFA from Carnegie Mellon University.
